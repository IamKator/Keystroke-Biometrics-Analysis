# Keystroke-Biometrics-Analysis


### Objective
This project investigates how keystroke dynamics can be used to identify users based on their typing patterns. Through rigorous data-driven analysis, It examines how keypress and release events are translated into features, identifies the most effective algorithms and feature sets, and considers practical applications and limitations The findings aim to advance our understanding of keystroke biometrics and machine learning, with the potential to develop more precise and reliable authentication systems for enhanced security.
